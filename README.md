# configs

This is my personal configs of several softwares I use. Feel free to use and comment. This is a ongoing work

## Observations
- I use Ubuntu 19.10;
- I use I3wm;
- I use Emacs (with graphical interface);
- I use Qutebrowser AND Firefox;
- The principal idea here is "Kill the Rat!", stop to use the mouse/touchpad and gain some agility in work;
- I'm configuring Emacs for Python, Javascript, Markdown, and Clojure for initial setup
   - Just Python at moment

## Emacs
  Copy **init.el** in emacs directory  to **~/.emacs.d/**
## I3
  ### To do
